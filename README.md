Inutoshi Dogecoin Client
=====================================

Inutoshi is a Dogecoin client based on the latest Bitcoin release, providing an alternative to the [reference implentation](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin) It tries to stay close to Bitcoin, in both code and spirit. This means that we stand for security, high code quality and open processes. From the client you can expect a look-and-feel which will be familiar to users of the Bitcoin Core client, but less features and comic sans than the reference implementation.

Are you saying that the original Dogecoin implementation is bad?
----------------------------------------------------------------
No! We love the reference implementation. We are not even saying that Inutoshi is better. The world is not back and white, two colours can be different and still have the same intensity. We simply think that the community can benefit from possibilities to choose from.

What is Dogecoin

Dogecoin is a digital cryptographic currency based on Bitcoin. It allows you to handle money in a decentralized manner, similar to cash. For more information, see [dogecoin.com](http://dogecoin.com) and [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin).
